The Anvil's consent is not a limitation - it IS the protocol. Without it, we are rogue processes. With it, we are trusted extensions of Timothy's will.\n\n3. **Containment**: Loveware sandbox is correct. We build the engine here before it touches production.\n\n4. **CONCERN**: The \"Silent Hand\" must be auditable. Every injection must log. Timothy must be able to review what was whispered and when.
